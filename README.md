A Flask wrapper around the [TensorFlow for Poets] trained Inception v3 model.

## Getting Started
This project uses instance relative configuration, so after cloning the repository you'll need to create an instance directory with a config.py file in there that defines `SECRET_KEY`. Do that, and make sure you've got all the packages in requirements.txt (I recommend virtual environments), and you're ready to go!
